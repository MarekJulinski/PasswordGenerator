It is an application that I implemented from folowing a course on udemy '100 days python bootcamp'.
It generates a password which is ready to be pasted to the website after clicking a button.
It can be saved on the json file if you would provide website and username.
In case you want to remind you the password, just input the website and click search.
It will display the username and password for the website.

HINT: passwords are not hashed or encrypted. Just to let you know ^_^
